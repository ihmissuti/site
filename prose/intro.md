I'm a dad, a software engineer, a husband, and a creator. I work at **Vox Media**, and I live near **Des Moines, Iowa**. I'm passionate about **solving hard problems** and creating great experiences for other developers and end-users.

I'm married to an [**amazing wife**](https://briannelarson.com), with whom I started a **software company** called [**Barkpass**](https://www.barkpass.com). Occasionally, I'll build things and write about them. This is one of those occasions.
