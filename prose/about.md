I was born and raised in **Iowa**, which is smack-dab in the middle of the United States. I grew up in a rural area, surrounded by corn and bean fields.

Now, I live and work in **Waukee, Iowa**, which is a suburb of Des Moines. It's a quaint but quickly-growing town with good schools and lots of opportunities.

## Professional Life

I am a software engineer at **[Vox Media](https://voxmedia.com)**. I'm part of the **Concert Platforms** team, which supports the engineering products behind **[Concert](https://concert.io)**, a premium digital advertising marketplace.

At Vox Media, my official title is **Lead Engineer 2**. Fancy, right? It means "senior with a hint of principal." I serve as a technical lead on my team for our **ad placement library** written in JavaScript, which is responsible for taking ads delivered by our ad server and inserting them into the article a user is reading in a friendly, non-obtrusive way.

I've also pioneered efforts to create a **real-time bidding server** which serves Concert ad creative to our 100+ Concert network publisher partners. It's a thrill to build a service that scales to **1+ billion monthly requests** and to see it contribute directly to the company's bottom line ðŸŽ‰.

More recently, I'm leading our team to build a **[self-service ad builder tool](https://www.axios.com/vox-media-google-launch-concert-local-ad-network-3405ad7a-6cf7-4d82-81d3-c028434415d2.html)** to support local advertisers and growth accounts at scale. We're building an amazing end-to-end user flow with React and GraphQL for the entire ad creation process, from uploading assets to entering payment details. I can't wait to share it with y'all.

I really enjoy working at Vox Media because I can **work from home** along with my other talented colleagues across the globe. Our culture is very nurturing, diverse and respectful. I love that I can go for a random afternoon jog and not have to make up the time later on, or mark a timesheet at the end of the day, or ask my boss for permission. I think a lot of workplaces _could_ be like this, but the leaders do not place the amount of **trust** Vox Media places in its employees to do good work without micromanagement.

Prior to Vox Media, I was a **lead developer** at an [ad agency](https://itsahappymedium.com) where we created a bunch of cool WordPress websites for lots of small regional clients.

## Personal Life

I married **[Bri](https://briannelarson.com)** in 2015, and we had a son **Barrett** in 2020. Our dogs **Luna and Sonny** keep us company. We get along awfully well together.

Our hobbies include watching almost every television show known to humankind, going on walks with our dogs, and hosting variety shows in our basement.

**Music** is a big thing in my life. I joined band in elementary school and learned how to play the piano, clarinet, tenor saxophone, and guitar. I joined the marching band at Iowa State University, as a sax the first three years and finally as a drum major my senior year. It was one of the most worthwhile and valuable experiences in my life. I still enjoy playing music with friends when I get the chance, and fiddling around on the piano during the day.

I studied **journalism** and **Spanish** while I was in college. Guess what? I don't work in either of those fields! But I did start my career as a broadcast TV producer at the local CBS affiliate in Des Moines. I produced the weekend morning news. I also did some [on](/glances/reporter-davinci)-[air](/glances/reporter-charter-school) [reporting](/glances/reporter-inmate-security) as an intern. It was neat, but it was also a ton of work for not a ton of reward.

## Miscellaneous Life

When I find the time, I try to give back to the community. I serve as the **treasurer** of the local chapter of the Lions Club, a **co-organizer** of a monthly [local web meetup](https://dsmwebgeeks.com), and a **mentor** for the [Waukee APEX](https://apex.waukeeschools.org/) technology program for high school students.

Since 2016, I've been going to a **CrossFit** gym. It's been one of the best communities I've ever joined, and I really enjoy the health benefits and accountability of working up a few times per week.

In the past, I've been a **newsletter editor** of my college alumni band, and an alumni **adviser** and **treasurer** (_for real though, I have zero treasurer experience but I keep ending up in treasurer roles for non-profit organizations_) for my college fraternity Beta Theta Pi.

## My Values

Here are some values by which I live currently. These change as I change, but these feel pretty good at the time of writing. Maybe they'll feel good to you, too, if you enjoy the ideas of a 30-year-old moron on the internet:

- **Curiousity is the root of growth**. I've learned so much by being curious and open to new ideas. The best people I've known and worked with are constantly curious. I'd hate to be surrounded by people who think they know how everything works â€”Â or don't know, and don't care to know.
- **Self-worth drives outward action**. This is a hard lesson I've learned in my 30 years on this planet. So many of my actions and inactions have been driven by a faltering sense of self-worth â€”Â that I wasn't _good enough_ or _fit enough_ or _worthy enough_. These things have resulted in shyness and lack of social growth, but they have (and sometimes still do, unfortunately) turn into projections I place on other people. Thankfully, I've been reading a lot of [BrenÃ© Brown](https://brenebrown.com/) and have been working on _Rising Strong_ in my life. It's also illuminating to see that when other people lash out and put you down, it's _almost always_ driven by their own insecurity and lack of self-worth.
- **I'm a creator, not a critic**. I've started noticing two distinct groups of people emerge in my life: creators and critics. There is no better place to notice this than the dumpster fire that is Twitter â€”Â where only hot takes and put-downs gain any traction. It's so ridiculously easy to put someone â€” or something â€”Â down, and it's so ridiculously hard to create something in earnest. [I want to be in the arena](https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/7280972-i-want-to-be-in-the-arena-i-want-to) and be a creator, and I love finding other likeminded creators.
- **Micro-activism will always beat macro-activism**. This pretty much means that I'd rather put my time, money and effort into improving the lives of people in my community than to post memes about presidential candidates 80 times a day. If people spent more time caring about their neighbors next door and less time being outraged about something happening thousands of miles away, the world would be a much better place.
