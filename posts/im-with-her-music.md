This is a blog post about the band **I'm With Her**.

One day a few months back, I was listening to Spotify. They played a neat song for me - a cover of [Vampire Weekend's "Hannah Hunt"](https://open.spotify.com/track/3t87C08isN6yw2DnWOorLm?si=QsgXjY8gRYCOdlTyeOSy1g).

After looking up the band — I'm With Her — I discovered Spotify had been frequently playing me another tune by the same band: ["Call My Name"](https://open.spotify.com/track/3cTbjXWKsCm1hg3TrUlFXC?si=gPylwWYHS7mi0HdBGDX5HQ).

**Sara Watkins**, **Sarah Jarosz**, and **Aoife O'Donovan** comprise I'm With Her. They're super talented artists in their own right. Sara Watkins was part of the folk band Nickel Creek a handful of years ago. Sarah Jarosz has an amazing voice and lots of solo tracks. And Aoife O'Donovan — just [listen to this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ze5Dns6CPE).

Fun fact: The name "I'm With Her" [predates the 2016 Presidential Election](https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/feb/18/im-with-her-band-interview-bluegrass-music-aoife-odonovan-sara-watkins-sarah-jarosz), apparently.

I'd classify them as a folk/bluegrass mix. They're fun to listen to!

My favorite, favorite, favorite rendition of theirs is their cover of "Hannah Hunt":

This is from their live performance at _Live From Here_. That show is the successor to _A Prairie Home Companion_ after Garrison Keillor left. It's now hosted by Chris Thile who was _also_ a part of Nickel Creek. Neat!

In this clip, something magical happens at the [3:50](https://youtu.be/v38ld7jN6L0?t=230) mark.

They throw in a slight change to their chord progression: switching from `E Bm D A` to `Em Bm D A`<sup>1</sup>. That high note Sara hits on the fiddle while the mandolin and guitar fill out the rest of the minor chord is _chef's kiss_.

One of my favorite things is watching Chris Thile's face light up with glee in the background when they hit that note.

I've always loved "Hannah Hunt," but ever since hearing this cover, I've added it to the top of my repetoire for [songs I sing to Barrett as lullabies](/posts/012-songs-sing-lullabies).

## More songs

Enough about Hannah Hunt.

You like Adele? Who doesn't. Here's another great cover: "Send My Love (To Your New Lover)"

## Even more songs

For a true fun-filled evening, you need to check out their [entire House of Blues set](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2xFAzPz6wk).

One of my favorite tunes is "Call My Name." This is the one I also heard on Spotify:

Another delightful moment happens here. In one of the final "_call my name_" refrains, they hit an extra sweet chord — supported by a Sara Watkins vocal accent note this time. See if you can spot it!

I'd be remiss if I didn't share the timestamp of "Crossin' Muddy Waters" within this same set. Sara Watkins GOES OFF on the fiddle at the end.

So yeah. That's **I'm With Her**.
